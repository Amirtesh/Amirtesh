# Hi, I'm Amirtesh Raghuram 

I am passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Bioinformatics**. Currently, I am pursuing a **B.Tech in Biotechnology** from **VIT Vellore** (2nd year), where I am honing my skills in both computational and biological sciences.

## ðŸš€ Current Skills:

### Machine Learning:
- Proficient in **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost** for building predictive models.
- Proficient in implementing **Deep Learning** techniques using **PyTorch** and building neural networks to work on tabular and image data, along with basics of Tensorflow.

### Bioinformatics:
- Performing **Protein-Ligand Docking** using tools like **AutoDock Vina**, **Smina**, **SwissDock**, **AutoDock 4.2** and **ADFR suite** for both rigid and flexibile docking.
- Performing **Molecular Dynamics Simulations** with **GROMACS**.
- Performing **MMPBSA analysis** using **gmx_MMPBSA** to calculate binding free energies.
- Usage of **computational drug discovery** tools such as **SwissADME**, **Swiss Target Prediction**, **Swiss Similarity**, **Protox**, **MolSoft**, **pkcsm**, and more.
- Basics of **RDKit** in python for working with molecules

### R Programming:
- Basics of data analysis and visualization libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2 in R.
- Basics of machine learning with R.
