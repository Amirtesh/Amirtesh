# Hi, I'm Amirtesh Raghuram 

I am passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Bioinformatics**. Currently, I am pursuing a **B.Tech in Biotechnology** from **VIT Vellore** (2nd year), where I am honing my skills in both computational and biological sciences.

## 🚀 Current Skills:

### Machine Learning:
- Proficient in **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost** for building predictive models.
- Proficient in implementing **Deep Learning** techniques using **PyTorch** and building neural networks to work on tabular and image data, along with basics of Tensorflow.

### **Bioinformatics:**
- Performing **Protein-Ligand Docking** using tools like **AutoDock Vina**, **Smina**, **SwissDock**, **AutoDock 4.2**, and **ADFR suite** for both rigid and flexible docking.  
- Performing **Molecular Dynamics Simulations** with **GROMACS**.  
- Performing **MMPBSA analysis** using **gmx_MMPBSA** to calculate binding free energies.  
- Ussage of **computational drug discovery tools** such as **SwissADME**, **Swiss Target Prediction**, **Swiss Similarity**, **Protox**, **MolSoft**, **pkcsm**, and more.  
- Usage of **RDKit** in Python for working with molecules.  
- **BioPython**:
  - Reading and processing biological sequence files in formats such as **FASTA** and **GenBank**.  
  - Creating and manipulating **SeqRecord** and **SeqFeature** objects.
  - Reading in sequence alignment files.
  - Performing sequence alignment using tools like **ClustalW**, **MUSCLE**, and **EMBOSS Needle/Water** (both within Python and via the EMBL web tools).  
  - Writing output files in various biological formats.  
  - Familiar with **pairwise sequence alignment** for sequence similarity studies.  


### R Programming:
- Basics of data analysis and visualization libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2 in R.
- Basics of machine learning with R.
